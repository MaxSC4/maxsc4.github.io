DigiRocks is an **interactive rock and thin-section visualization tool** that runs directly in your browser.  
It was designed to make geological material visualization easier for **students and researchers**, with both **2D and 3D viewing modes**.

Developed at *Université Paris-Saclay (GEOPS)*, DigiRocks is used to display, explore, and document geological samples — from simple thin sections to photogrammetric rock models.

### 🪨 Features

- **2D Viewer:** zoom, pan, and annotate rock thin-sections (JPEG/PNG).  
- **3D Viewer:** load `.obj` / `.mtl` models with orbit controls, lighting, and scale bar.  
- **Screenshot export:** capture annotated scenes directly from the app.  
- **Browser-based:** no installation required; everything runs locally via Three.js and Vite.

I am a geologist passionate about volcanology, tectonics, planetology, and the application of machine learning in geosciences.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Geology at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), where I explore how computational methods and data-driven models can be used to study magmatic, tectonic, and planetary processes.

Beyond geology, I am deeply interested in computer science and programming. I regularly develop scientific tools in Python, JavaScript, and C#, focusing on automation, modeling, and visualization in Earth and planetary sciences.

My goal is to bridge the gap between Earth processes and data science, contributing to a more quantitative and interdisciplinary understanding of our planet and others.
